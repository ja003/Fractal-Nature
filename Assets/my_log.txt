-----8.12.2015-----
implementation of varying river width
fixed BelongsToPath parameter
fixed river with parameter
application of median filter


-----5.12.2015-----
fixed incorrect Get8Neighbours function
class decomposition into seperate function logic

-----28.11.2015-----
improved DigRiver algorithm (currently called DigRiver3)
new feature
	determines whether point belongs to the current part of path
fixed corner check error
implemented DistortPath
	randomly moves points of path by given parameter
	! can cause incorrect "order/position" of points in path
	! better solve this by editing Flood algorithm to choose not
	 only from 8-neighbourhood (might cost much more!)


-----23.11.2015-----
improved digriver algorithm
	-corner fails, probably due to incorrect vertices in path
	

-----13.11.2015-----
improved DigRiver algorithm
	-still has corner check bug

-----13.11.2015-----
improved DigRiver algorithm
	expects the path to be composed only from points connected 
	horizontally/diagonally/vertically (not for example [0,0] -> [5,1])
	
	uses sinc function to shape the corridor
	then it smoothes it using median filter (doesn't look very good)


-----6.11.2015-----
implemented FloodFromLowestRegion algorithm
process
	1)find point on terrain with lowest sum of heights from its nighbourhood 
	2)run flood algorithm with increasing threshold until it reaches 2 different sides
	3)connect found paths


-----2.11.2015-----
fixed some bugs with airplane and on-flight generation
implemented DigRiver function

-----28.10.2015-----
decomposition of project
Erosion and Filter functions moved to seperate classes

-----23.10.2015-----
implementing BestDirectionRiver algorithm based on finding highest 
and lowest vertex on sides and conntecting them
river track is curved by finding lowest points in area
around the line connecting found points

-----19.10.2015-----
code decomposition
try to decompose Scripts into more classes
seperated the original and created my own folder

-----18.10.2015-----
first very simple implementation
-added menu button to create river (no user parameters)

-1)
river goes through midle of terrain
fixed river width
all vertices y value = 0

-2)
vertices y value = vertex.y - p, where p is small number on "shores"
and highest in the middle

problems: 
-texture on modified terrain does not look good (probably due to 
not modifiing UVs)
-on fly generating terrain destroys part of the river
