first very simple implementation
-added menu button to create river (no user parameters)
-1)
river goes through midle of terrain
fixed river width
all vertices y value = 0

-2)
vertices y value = vertex.y - p, where p is small number on "shores"
and highest in the middle

problems: 
-texture on modified terrain does not look good (probably due to 
not modifiing UVs)
-on fly generating terrain destroys part of the river
