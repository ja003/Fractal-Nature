fix FloodFromLowestPoint 
	-remove borderOffset so it reaches exactly to the border
	-or at least connect it with border
	
fix DigRiver
	-corner check

-----6.11.2015-----
prefer longer river [L->R / U->D, ne L->U,...]

use 8 neigbourhood

when algorithm finds edge, stop searching on that side


-----2.11.2015-----
make number of mountain to perserve optionable

smooth peeks of mountain
 +ok
Depth of a river in DigRiver function should be also based on 
original height of processed vertex

fix connecting of 2 parts of the river (makes 2x deep dig on intersection 
 - shoukd be solved by previously metioned depth function)
 
-----28.10.2015-----
rework terrain generation algorithm to produce more realistic 
environment by partitioning into regions with different hight
parameters

+solved by addidng function: "Perserve mountains"
 
-----22.10.2015-----
improve BestDirectionRiver algorithm
-user can generate different tracks and then confirm one, which will 
be created
-implement river coridor function


-----19.10.2015-----
ask if its a good idea to decompose the code or it is okay to leave it as 
messy as it is 

+ok

-----18.10.2015-----
read some existing methods and approaches and try to implement 
some of them
